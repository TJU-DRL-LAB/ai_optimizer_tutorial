# AI Optimizer

## Introduction
AI-Optimizer is a next-generation deep reinforcement learning suit, providing rich algorithm libraries ranging from model-free to model-based RL algorithms, from single-agent to multi-agent algorithms. Moreover, AI-Optimizer contains a flexible and easy-to-use distributed training framework for efficient policy training.
