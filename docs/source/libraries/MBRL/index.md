This repo contains a unified opensource code implementation for the Model-Based  Reinforcement Learning methods.(@TJU). MBRL-Lib provides implementations of popular MBRL algorithms as examples of how to use this library. You can find them in the MBRL-Lib folder. We have collected some of the mainstream MBRL algorithms and made some code-level optimizations. Bringing these algorithms together in a unified framework can save the researchers time in finding comparative baselines without the need to search around for implementations. Currently, we have implemented Dreamer, MBPO,BMPO, MuZero, PlaNet, SampledMuZero, CaDM and we plan to keep increasing this list in the future.  We will constantly update this repo to include new research made by TJU-DRL-Lab to ensure sufficient coverage and reliability. **We hope in the future to present one of the most comprehensive Model-Based library so far , which covered most mainstream algorithms in Model-Based RL area.** What' more, We want to cover as many interesting new directions as possible, and then divide it into the topic we listed above, to give you some inspiration and ideas for your RESEARCH. This repo will be constantly updated to include new researches made by TJU-RL-Lab. (The development of this repo is in progress at present.)

## 

## Introduction

Reinforcement learning algorithms can be divided into two main categories: **the first category is `Model Free` methods, which are able to learn a value function or a strategy function directly by interacting with the environment without modeling the environment; the second category is `Model Based` methods, which need to model the environment by interacting with it and then use the model to make action planning or strategy selection**. The model free algorithm has achieved great results in many experimental scenarios and game environments due to its simple implementation and high asymptotic performance, but the sampling efficiency of the model free method is extremely low, resulting in a large number of interactions with the environment. However, the model free class of methods is extremely inefficient in terms of sampling efficiency and requires a lot of interaction with the environment. In contrast, the model-based algorithm models the environment and fits the dynamics model of the environment **with high sampling efficiency**.

The model of the environment is a representation model that explicitly contains knowledge about the environment or the task, and generally two types of models are included: a transition model or a dynamics model and the reward model. Once this model is modeled, it can be properly integrated into the interaction with the environment and the learning of strategies, as shown in the above figure. 
### Problems to Solve

The current classifications of the mainstream algorithms in the modern Model-Based RL area are orthogonal, which means some algorithms can be grouped into different categories according to different perspectives. In this branch, we focus on two key questions  :`How to Learn a Model` and `How to Utilize a Model`.

- `How to Learn a Model` mainly focuses on how to build the environment model. 
- `How to Utilize a Model` cares about how to utilize the learned model. 

From the perspective of action execution, we can also divide `Model-Based RL` into two categories: `policy learning` and `planning`. 

- `policy learning` mainly focuses on training a parametric policy network explicitly. 

- `planning` cares about how to optimize the action sequence implicitly.

There are many other classifications and we can list some of them here. From the perspective of the dynamics model, we can divide dynamics models into three categories:`forward model`„ÄÅ`reverse/backward model,` and `inverse model`. From the perspective of the estimation method, the methods can be categorized as`parametric ` and `non-parametric` or `exact` and `approximate`. From the perspective of planning updating, the methods can be categorized as `value update ` and `policy update`.

### Core Directions

The current classifications of the mainstream algorithms in the modern Model-Based RL area are orthogonal, which means some algorithms can be grouped into different categories according to different perspectives. It‚Äôs quite hard to draw an accurate taxonomy of algorithms in the Model-Based RL area.  **So we think it would be more appropriate to give the algorithm to a specific topic rather than a simple classification.** Ignoring the differences in specific methods, the purpose of MBRL algorithms can be more finely divided into four directions as follows: `Reduce Model Error`„ÄÅ`Faster Planning`„ÄÅ` Higher Tolerance to Model Error` „ÄÅ`Scalability to Harder Problems`.  For the problem of `How to Learn a Model`, we can study reducing model error to learn a more accurate world model or learning a world model with higher tolerance to model error. For the problem of `How to Utilize a Model`, we can study faster planning with a learned model or the scalability of the learned model to harder problems.

### üí¶Key Features

#### Why MBRL ?

Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) enjoys several benefits, such as data-efficiency and planning, by learning a model of the environments dynamics. The model of the environment is a representation model that explicitly contains knowledge about the environment or the task, and generally two types of models are included: a transition model or a dynamics model and the reward model. Once this model is modeled, it can be properly integrated into the interaction with the environment and the learning of strategies. **MBRL is now becoming an increasingly promising direction in RL!**

#### Why Our Lib?

Research in model-based RL has not been very standardized. It is fairly common for authors to experiment with self-designed environments, and there are several separate lines of research, which are sometimes closed-sourced or not reproducible. And for this, we have collected some of the mainstream MBRL algorithms and made some code-level optimizations. Bringing these algorithms together in a unified framework can save the researchers time in finding comparative baselines without the need to search around for implementations.

With this repo and our research works, we want to draw the attention of RL community to studies on Model Based RL.

- For people who are insterested in model based RL, our introductions in this repo and our [ZhiHu blog series](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/425318401) can be a preliminary tutorial.

- For Researchers in model-based RL, we collect several separate lines of research, which are sometimes closed-sourced or not reproducible and make some code-level optimizations for the convinience to find comparative baselines without the need to search around for implementations.

We expect that our research thoughts and proposed topic for MBRL area can open up some new angles for future works on more advanced RL. **What' more, We want to cover as many interesting new directions as possible, and then divide it into the topic we listed above, to give you some inspiration and ideas for your RESEARCH.**  Currently, we have implemented Dreamer, MBPO,BMPO, MuZero, PlaNet, SampledMuZero, CaDM and we plan to keep increasing this list in the future.  We will constantly update this repo to include new research made by TJU-DRL-Lab to ensure sufficient coverage and reliability. We are also looking forward to feedback in any form to promote more in-depth researches. See more [here](https://github.com/TJU-DRL-LAB/AI-Optimizer/tree/main/modelbased-rl).

To clone this repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:TJU-DRL-LAB/modelbased-rl.git
```

Note that this repo is a collection of multiple research branches (according to the taxonomy). 
Environments and code frameworks may differ among different branches. Thus, please follow the installation guidance provided in the specific branch you are insterested in.

## Usage Guidance

We give some usage guidance about installing dependencies for beginners here, and also introduce how to modify the algorithm based on our implement version.

Here we introduce how to configure your own dataset and modify the algorithm based on your own design for .

### Dependencies

First follow the vanilla Dreamer and MBPO method and install the coresponding dependencies (we introduced them in Dreamer/README.md and MBPO/README.md). Then run ED2-Dreamer or ED2-MBPO (following the detail operation in ED2-Dreamer/README.md or ED2-MBPO/README.md).

### Modify algorithms

We integrated related works and codes into a unified framework, in order to make it easy to compare the main improvements between different works. For example, for Dreamer and ED2-Dreamer, we integrate the world model construction of both methods in a single moduel, and the same is true for other parts such as policies or wrappers. In this way, you can **target the modifications you want to improve, and quickly verify and compare**.
